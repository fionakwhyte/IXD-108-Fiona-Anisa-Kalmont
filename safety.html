        Avalanches occur as layers in a snowpack slide off. A snowpack is simply 
        layers of snow that build up in an area, such as the side of a mountain. 
        In winter, repeated snowfalls build a snowpack dozens of meters thick. 
        The layers of a snowpack vary in thickness and texture. The bonds between 
        the layers of a snowpack may be weak. Melted snow that refreezes may cause 
        a slick coating of ice to form on the surface of a layer. A new snowfall may 
        not stick to this slippery layer, and it may slide off. During spring thaw, melted 
        snow can seep through a snowpack, making the surface of a lower layer slippery. 
        Added weight or vibration can easily send the top layers of a snowpack hurtling downhill.

    <p>
        Hypothermia, or low body temperature, is a condition that occurs when your
         body's temperature drops below 35 degrees Celsius. The average normal body 
         temperature is 37 C. Hypothermia is a medical emergency. When your body temperature 
         is dangerously low, your brain and body can't function properly. Left untreated, 
         hypothermia can lead to cardiac arrest (when your heart stops beating) and death.

<h3>What Causes Hypothermia?</h3>
<p>
    Hypothermia occurs after exposure to cold, wet or windy conditions. 
    When you're exposed to cold, your body expends energy to keep you warm. 
    Eventually, with continued exposure to cold temperatures, your body uses 
    up its stored energy and your body temperature begins to fall. You're not 
    able to warm yourself back up. Symptoms will progress from mild to severe 
    with prolonged exposure. While most cases of hypothermia occur at very cold 
    temperatures, the condition can affect you even in cooler temperatures over 
    4.4 C if you become chilled from sweat, rain or submersion in cold water. 
    Hypothermia occurs under environmental conditions (wet, cool/cold or windy) 
    that cause a person's body to lose more heat than it generates.

<h3>How to Treat Hypothermia?</h3>
<p>
    Hypothermia treatment includes the prevention of further heat loss and the process 
    of rewarming. If you're with someone who has hypothermia, call for help and then take the following steps:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Move the person to a warm, dry location</li>
    <li>Remove wet clothing and replace with dry clothing</li>
    <li>Cover them up with a jacket, hat and blanket</li>
    <li>Apply external heat to their skin, such as with a heat lamp or hot pack</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When hypothermia is more severe, healthcare providers may also need to:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Insert an IV into your vein and pump warm fluids into your body</li>
    <li>Give you warm oxygen through a mask or breathing tube</li>
    <li>Use a machine that warms your blood and pumps it back into your body</li>
</ul>

    An avalanche is one of the most powerful events in nature. A fractured mass of snow 
    may flow down a slope or become airborne. As a large avalanche speeds down a mountainside, 
    it may compress the air below it, producing a powerful wind that can blow a house apart, 
    breaking windows, splintering doors, and tearing off the roof.
