        <h2>Bear Safety</h2>
        <p>
            British Columbia is 'bear country', and bear encounters can happen almost anywhere. Black bears can be found in every part of the province, including on the outskirts of cities and in suburbs.

B.C. is also blessed with a healthy population of grizzly bears, although they no longer live in certain areas due to human activity. Learn which species live in the park you plan to visit by checking the park's webpage.
        </p>
        <h3>Prevent Habituation</h3>
        <p>
            Most bears are wary of humans and generally avoid encounters. Some, often those in high-use parks, may have learned to tolerate humans and lost their wariness. This is known as 'habituation'.
Some bears may be mildly habituated to humans while others are heavily habituated. This is a survival mechanism and is not necessarily negative unless human food or garbage is involved.

Bears that receive food from hikers or eat garbage or food at campsites start to associate people with food. When bears become 'food conditioned' this way, they may start to approach campers or hikers, and behave aggressively.
        </p>
        <h4>What to do in a bear encounter</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If you see a bear, stop where you are and stay calm. Never run away. Observe the bear's behaviour to decide on your next move.</li>
            <li>Check you have your bear spray and make sure you can get to it quickly, if you need it.</li>
            <li>If the bear has not noticed you, leave the area quietly. Go back the way you came while keeping an eye on them</li>
            <li>If the bear has noticed you but is not reacting to your presence, speak softly and back away slowly.</li>
            <li>If the bear becomes agitated, makes noises, or seems aggressive, continue backing away slowly and talking softly. Do not run away.</li>
            <li>While backing away, do not make eye contact, but keep the bear in sight. Take your bear spray out and get ready to use it.</li>
            <li>If the bear charges, stand your ground and discharge your bear spray when they are within spraying range.</li>
            <li>If the bear is steadily approaching you, try to get out of their way, preferably onto higher ground.</li>
            <li>If the bear continues to approach you, yell at them. If they get within spraying range of you, discharge your bear spray.</li>
            <li>If the bear knocks you down, roll onto your stomach and lie still. Protect the back of your head. Spread your feet slightly, so they cannot roll you over.</li>
            <li>If the bear continues to attack, or if they appear to be predatory, fight them off with everything at hand. Focus on the bear's eyes and nose.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>FEB</h3>
        <h2>11</h2>
        <h2>Public Avalanche Warning for Western Canada</h2>
        <p>
            Avalanche Canada, in partnership with Parks Canada, Kananaskis Country, and the province of British Columbia, is issuing a Special Public Avalanche Warning (SPAW) for recreational backcountry users across the mountainous regions of western Canada. A dramatic increase in temperatures is expected to destabilize the snowpack, resulting in dangerous, destructive avalanches. This special warning is in effect immediately and will apply through the end of Monday, May 1.
